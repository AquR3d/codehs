For each of the following, compare advantanges and 
disadvantages with respect to iterating through a vector:

1. For loop with index values:
u can access certain places with index values

2. For loop with iterator
same thing tbh just more complicated, iterator helps with certain vector methods that u cant do
with just index values like erasing a value

3. For-each loop
now u just dont have numbers but ez to just write it yk automagic 0-end
